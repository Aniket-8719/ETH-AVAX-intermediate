# **ErrorHandling Smart Contract**
The ErrorHandling smart contract demonstrates different error handling mechanisms in Solidity. It provides examples of using require, assert, and revert statements to handle errors and exceptions in Solidity contracts.

## Getting Started
To use the ErrorHandling contract, you'll need to have a Solidity development environment set up. Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
* Solidity compiler (version 0.8.x)
## Usage
1. Clone the repository or create a new Solidity file and copy the code from index.sol into it.

2. Compile the Solidity code using the Solidity compiler. Make sure to set the compiler version to 0.8.x.

3. Deploy the contract to a compatible blockchain network, such as Ethereum.

4. Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the checkValue function, providing a uint256 value as an argument.

5. The functions in the contract will perform the following error handling operations:

    * setValue() uses the require statement to check if the value is greater than 10. If the condition is not met, it throws an exception with the error message "New value must be greater than 10."

    * assertExample() uses the assert statement to check if the two integer values passed are equal or not. If the condition is false, it indicates an internal error, and the contract execution is reverted.

    * revertExample() uses the revert statement to revert the transaction and throw an exception if the value is equal to 0. The error message "Division by zero is not allowed" is provided in this case.


## Error Handling Mechanisms
The ErrorHandling contract demonstrates the following error handling mechanisms:

* require statement: Used to enforce a condition that must be met for the function to continue execution. It throws an exception if the condition is not met.

* assert statement: Used to check for conditions that should never be false. It is typically used to validate internal consistency. If the condition is false, it indicates an internal error, and the contract execution is reverted.

* revert statement: Used to revert the current transaction and throw an exception with a specific error message.
